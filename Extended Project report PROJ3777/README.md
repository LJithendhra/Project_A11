# Smart Traffic Management System

This repository contains the implementation of a **Smart Traffic Management System** that detects emergency vehicles and optimizes traffic signals dynamically using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

**Title:** Image & Video Processing, Analysis of Traffic Signal Areas to Find Emergency Vehicles Using Deep Learning Models  
**Cluster Name:** AI/ML (Group: A11)  
**Project Supervisor:** Sanhita Manna  
**Project Coordinator:** Dr. Ambar Bajpai  

## Mini Project Highlights (PROJ2999)

1. Developed a real-time vehicle detection system using advanced YOLOv11 models.
2. Applied data augmentation techniques such as greyscale conversion, blurring, and noise addition for robustness.
3. Achieved over 90% detection accuracy after training for 50 epochs.
4. The system detects ambulances, fire engines, and other priority vehicles, dynamically adjusting traffic signals in real time.

## Major Project Abstract (PROJ3999)

Traffic congestion and delays for high-priority vehicles like ambulances and fire engines are critical challenges. This project addresses these challenges by:
- Analyzing vehicle density at traffic lanes.
- Identifying high-priority vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire engines).
- Dynamically adjusting signal timings (5–120 seconds) based on real-time traffic conditions and vehicle proximity.

### Future Goals:
- Improve detection accuracy for fire engines and other priority vehicles.
- Incorporate distance measurement for high-priority vehicles to further optimize traffic signal timings.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to analyze vehicle density at traffic lanes.
- Enhance the accuracy of fire engine detection.
- Integrate traffic signal control systems for real-time optimization.
