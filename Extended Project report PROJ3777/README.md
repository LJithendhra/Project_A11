## 📊 Major Project Abstract (PROJ3999)  

Traffic congestion and delays for high-priority vehicles like **ambulances and fire engines** are critical challenges. This project addresses these challenges by:  
- 🚗 **Analyzing vehicle density** at traffic lanes.  
- 🚑 **Identifying high-priority vehicles** (e.g., ambulances, fire engines).  
- ⏳ **Dynamically adjusting signal timings** (5–120 seconds) based on real-time traffic conditions and vehicle proximity.  

### 🔭 Future Goals:  
🔹 Improve detection accuracy for **fire engines and other priority vehicles**.  
🔹 Incorporate **distance measurement** for high-priority vehicles to further optimize traffic signal timings.

## 🎯 Objectives  

📌 Develop a **machine learning model** to analyze vehicle density at traffic lanes.  
📌 Enhance the **accuracy of fire engine detection**.  
📌 Integrate **traffic signal control systems** for real-time optimization.
