## System Design

### 1. System Architecture
The Smart Traffic Management System comprises the following components:

- **Input Module:**
  - Captures real-time video feed from traffic cameras.
  - Pre-processes frames using OpenCV (resizing, noise removal).

- **Object Detection Module:**
  - Uses YOLOv11 deep learning model to detect vehicles, including high-priority ones (e.g., ambulances, fire engines).
  - Outputs vehicle classifications and bounding boxes.

- **Traffic Analysis Module:**
  - Analyzes vehicle density for each traffic lane.
  - Identifies proximity of high-priority vehicles to the traffic signal.

- **Signal Control Module:**
  - Adjusts signal timings dynamically based on vehicle density and priority.
  - Interfaces with traffic signal controllers via APIs or hardware integration.

- **Monitoring Dashboard:**
  - Displays live traffic feed, detected vehicles, and signal statuses for operators.
