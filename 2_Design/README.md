## Design

### 1. System Architecture

The system is designed to manage traffic signals dynamically based on real-time video analysis. It involves the following components:

- **Input Module:** Captures real-time video feed from traffic cameras and preprocesses it for analysis.
- **Object Detection Module:** Uses YOLOv11 to detect and classify vehicles, including high-priority vehicles like ambulances and fire engines.
- **Traffic Analysis Module:** Analyzes lane-wise vehicle density and identifies the proximity of high-priority vehicles.
- **Signal Control Module:** Dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on the analysis.
- **Monitoring Dashboard:** Displays real-time traffic data, including vehicle detection and signal status.
