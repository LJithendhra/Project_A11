# Methodology



## Component Design)


### 1. Input Module
- **Functionality:** Captures video feed from cameras and preprocesses it using OpenCV.
- **Key Features:**
  - Resizes video frames for efficient processing.
  - Removes noise for better object detection accuracy.

### 2. Object Detection Module
- **Functionality:** Detects and classifies vehicles in video frames using YOLOv11.
- **Key Features:**
  - Bounding boxes for detected vehicles.
  - Classification of high-priority vehicles.

### 3. Traffic Analysis Module
- **Functionality:** Analyzes vehicle density and prioritizes high-priority vehicles.
- **Key Features:**
  - Calculates lane-wise vehicle density.
  - Identifies the proximity of high-priority vehicles to traffic signals.

### 4. Signal Control Module
- **Functionality:** Adjusts traffic signal timings dynamically.
- **Key Features:**
  - Allocates timing based on lane density and vehicle priority.
  - Communicates with signal controllers via APIs.

### 5. Monitoring Dashboard
- **Functionality:** Displays real-time traffic conditions and system status.
- **Key Features:**
  - Live video feed with detected vehicles.
  - Lane density and signal timing visualization.
