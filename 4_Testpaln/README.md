### 2. Test Scenarios

#### **Test Case 1: Vehicle Detection Accuracy**
- **Objective:** Validate the accuracy of YOLOv11n in detecting vehicles.
- **Steps:**
  1. Provide video feed with a mix of regular and high-priority vehicles.
  2. Run the detection algorithm and compare outputs with ground truth data.
- **Expected Outcome:** YOLOv11n detects vehicles with >90% accuracy under normal conditions.

#### **Test Case 2: Augmentation Impact on Detection**
- **Objective:** Evaluate the effect of augmentation techniques (greyscale, noise, blur) on detection accuracy.
- **Steps:**
  1. Train the model with augmented datasets (e.g., greyscale, blurred, and noisy images).
  2. Test the model on augmented video feeds.
- **Expected Outcome:** The model performs robustly with augmented data, maintaining >85% accuracy.

#### **Test Case 3: Signal Adjustment Timing**
- **Objective:** Ensure that traffic signal timings are adjusted dynamically within 2 seconds.
- **Steps:**
  1. Simulate traffic scenarios with varying vehicle densities and high-priority vehicles.
  2. Measure the time taken to adjust signal timings after detection.
- **Expected Outcome:** Signal timings are adjusted within the 2-second threshold.

#### **Test Case 4: Real-Time Performance**
- **Objective:** Verify that the system processes real-time video feeds without delays.
- **Steps:**
  1. Input live video streams from CCTV cameras.
  2. Monitor detection, classification, and signal adjustment in real-time.
- **Expected Outcome:** The system processes real-time feeds with no significant latency.

#### **Test Case 5: Lane-Wise Vehicle Density Analysis**
- **Objective:** Ensure accurate calculation of vehicle density for each lane.
- **Steps:**
  1. Provide video feed with known vehicle counts in each lane.
  2. Run density analysis and compare outputs with the expected counts.
- **Expected Outcome:** Vehicle density analysis is accurate to within ±5%.

#### **Test Case 6: Dashboard Functionality**
- **Objective:** Test the monitoring dashboard for usability and data accuracy.
- **Steps:**
  1. Access the dashboard during system operation.
  2. Verify the display of real-time data, including vehicle detections, lane densities, and signal timings.
- **Expected Outcome:** Dashboard displays accurate, real-time information.
