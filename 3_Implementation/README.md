## 🚀 Implementation Workflow

The project implementation is divided into the following steps:

### 🔹 Step 1: Dataset Collection and Preparation
- **🎯 Task:** Collect vehicle datasets from sources like Kaggle, Roboflow, and open-source repositories.
- **📌 Steps:**
  - 🏷️ Label and annotate vehicle images using tools like **CVAT.ai**.
  - 📏 Resize images to a uniform resolution of **640x640 pixels**.
  - 🔄 Apply preprocessing techniques such as **auto-orientation and greyscale conversion**.
  - 🎨 Perform **data augmentation**, including adding noise, blurring, and greyscale conversion.

### 🔹 Step 2: Model Training
- **🎯 Task:** Train the **YOLOv11** model for object detection.
- **📌 Steps:**
  - ⚙️ Use **YOLOv11n** for better performance after testing **YOLOv11m**.
  - 🏋️ Train the model with **50 epochs** to achieve **>90% detection accuracy**.
  - 🔬 Validate the model under varied conditions like **noise and different lighting scenarios**.

### 🔹 Step 3: Real-Time Video Processing
- **🎯 Task:** Process real-time video feed from CCTV cameras.
- **📌 Steps:**
  - 🎥 Capture video frames using **OpenCV**.
  - 🖼️ Pass frames through the **YOLOv11 model** for vehicle detection and classification.
  - 🚦 Calculate **vehicle density in each lane** and identify high-priority vehicles.

### 🔹 Step 4: Dynamic Signal Adjustment
- **🎯 Task:** Assign signal timings dynamically based on vehicle density and priority.
- **📌 Steps:**
  - ⏳ Allocate time to each lane within a range of **5–120 seconds**.
  - 🔗 Integrate with **traffic signal controllers** to adjust timings in real-time.

### 🔹 Step 5: Monitoring and Visualization
- **🎯 Task:** Build a dashboard to monitor traffic conditions.
- **📌 Steps:**
  - 📡 Display **real-time video feed** and vehicle detection results.
  - 📊 Show **lane-wise density** and current signal timings.
